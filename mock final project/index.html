        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a popular tiktoker, I post one of my passions,
        anime, I started tiktok when I was around 8 years old.
        </p>

        <p>As I got older I found my passion in web design. I started making my own little websites
            (unhosted) on <a href="https://www.code.org" target="_blank">Code.org</a>
I was making simple websites without much knowledge to what I was doing
but now? Now I know what I am doing and I am so much more expirienced than I was before
