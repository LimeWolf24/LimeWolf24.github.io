    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Natalie, I have one dog, two brothers
    and one sister.
    </p>
    <p>I am 15, my birthday is December 24th 2009
        I have moved homes a lot in my younger years
        so I am greatful to have found my forever home,
        and I don't know how life would be without my oldest
        brother there with me the whole time.
    </p>
    <p>I am very endearing and persistint, I tend to
        not give up on when I ask someone something and 
        they avoid the question, depending on what I asked
        I tend to bother and won't stop til I get an 
        answer.
    </p>
