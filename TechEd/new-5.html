    <p>Sandpaper and Sanding Block- Sandpaper is used for small touch ups and smoothing. Sanding Blocks are blocks of wood with sides of sandpaper, some people use scrap peices of wood and wrap sandpaper around it, which works just as well. When using sandpaper, the higher the number, the less friction, the lower the number the more friction and grit. Meaning start with the lower numbered sandpapers and move up as you finish the project.</p> <br>
