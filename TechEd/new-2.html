    <p>When you use the workshop right, you will be able to use it more as well throughout the year. It is up to the teacher wheather your class is ready or not, even if your class seems ready there are rules in the workshop; when using saws there are squares in front of the saws, that is the person's space, people who are walking by may not enter the square; you may not have a friend turn on/off machines FOR you, but you may ASK for HELP with it, they can TEACH you how or you just need to listen better when the teacher teachs you how to use things properly; if you were in the workshop you must help clean up the workshop, if you help clean up, the teacher will provide you with a pass to the next class if needed. If you don't help clean up, the teacher will be less likely to let you into the woodshop as much.</p>
    <p>When using sanders it is important to keep your hands away from the sandpaper as it can and possibly will take skin off- sanders move fast and can be dangerous if misused.</p>
